# Is it real?

## Introduction
**Is it real?** is a scam detection tool that helps users check if online messages, links, or screenshots might be scams. Online scams are increasing, and many people — especially youth, newcomers, and seniors — struggle to know what is safe. Our tool analyzes user input, explains risks clearly, highlights red flags, and suggests safe next steps.
